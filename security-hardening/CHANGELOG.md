# CHANGELOG — security-hardening

All notable changes follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.1.22] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- `install.sh`: on hosts listed in `NAMESPACE_OVERRIDE_HOSTS` (currently:
  `pblinuxutility`), the installer now deploys a host-specific systemd drop-in
  override that resets `ProtectSystem=`, `PrivateTmp=`, `ProtectKernelModules=`,
  and `ProtectKernelTunables=`.  These directives require `CLONE_NEWNS` (mount
  namespace support) and cause **exit 226 (EXIT_NAMESPACE)** on container/VM
  hosts whose kernel or container runtime does not permit unprivileged mount
  namespaces.  The source unit files are unchanged; full sandboxing is preserved
  on PBWEBSRV03 and any other capable host.

  Drop-in sources: `overrides/pblinuxutility/pb-security-hardening-check.service.d/`
  and `overrides/pblinuxutility/pb-security-hardening-check-monthly.service.d/`.

  See `overrides/pblinuxutility/README.md` and DEV-GUIDE.md §6 KFC-R02.

## [2.1.21] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- **`main()`: `INFO` status counted in `warn_count`, inflating summary warning
  count by 1.**
  The summary loop used a single `WARN|INFO` branch, so the `Fail2ban: INFO`
  result (fail2ban not installed — expected and intentional) was counted as a
  warning.  This caused the console/log summary to show `Warnings: 2` when
  only 1 genuine WARN existed, and embedded the inflated count in email
  subjects.  Fixed by splitting `INFO` into its own `info_count` variable.
  `warn_count` now reflects only genuine `WARN`-status checks.  `info_count`
  is included in the log summary (`Info: N`) and the HTML summary card.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/test_security_hardening.sh`: added T26.
  T26: regression guard — in a mixed-status set containing one WARN and one
  INFO, `warn_count` equals 1 and `info_count` equals 1 (INFO does not
  contribute to `warn_count`).

### KFC — new entries

**KFC-SH04** (security-hardening component, `main()`)

- **Version observed:** v2.1.14–v2.1.20
- **Failure mode:** Summary loop uses `WARN|INFO` branch; any INFO-status
  check increments `warn_count`.  With Fail2ban not installed (the common
  case), `Warnings` in console/log/HTML/email is always one higher than the
  actual number of WARN checks.  Operators see `Warnings: 2` with only one
  real warning, and email subjects state the wrong count.
- **Root cause:** `INFO` is semantically distinct from `WARN` but was
  bucketed with it in the count loop.  There was no separate counter.
- **Fix applied:** v2.1.21 — separate `info_count` variable; `WARN|INFO`
  branch split into `WARN)` and `INFO)` cases.  `info_count` exposed in log
  summary and HTML.
- **Current-version mitigation:** T26 guards against regression to the
  combined `WARN|INFO` branch.

**KFC-SH05** (security-hardening component, host configuration / `check_ssh_security`)

- **Version observed:** OpenSSH 9.6p1 / Ubuntu 24.04 (pblinuxutility,
  observed 2026-05-30)
- **Failure mode:** `PasswordAuthentication no` in `99-hardening.conf` is
  overridden by `PasswordAuthentication yes` in `50-cloud-init.conf` despite
  `99` sorting after `50`. `sshd -T` correctly reports `passwordauthentication
  yes` (the daemon genuinely accepts password logins). All config files appear
  correct on inspection; `sshd -t` passes; `systemctl reload ssh` has no
  effect. The checker reports WARN accurately — the WARN is genuine.
- **Root cause:** OpenSSH 9.6p1 on Ubuntu 24.04 processes `Include` glob
  matches in **reverse** lexicographic order on this host. `99-hardening.conf`
  is processed first; `50-cloud-init.conf` is processed last and wins.
  The mechanism is not fully characterised (may be filesystem readdir order,
  a glob implementation detail, or an OpenSSH version-specific behaviour).
  Confirmed by: removing `50-cloud-init.conf` caused `sshd -T` to flip to
  `passwordauthentication no`.
- **Fix applied:** Deleted `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf`.
  Cloud-init is permanently disabled on this host (`cloud-init status:
  disabled`; `cloud-init.service` not found) and will not regenerate the file.
- **Current-version mitigation:** No checker code change — the checker
  correctly reported WARN. Operators encountering this condition on other hosts
  should verify `cloud-init status` before deleting the file. If cloud-init is
  active, disable the SSH module instead:
  ```
  sudo cloud-init clean --configs network   # or
  echo 'network: {config: disabled}' | sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network.cfg
  ```
  A future improvement could detect the conflict by comparing each drop-in
  file's `PasswordAuthentication` directive against `sshd -T` output and
  warning when a lower-numbered drop-in overrides a higher-numbered one.

---

## [2.1.20] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **`check_ssh_security()`: `AllowUsers`/`AllowGroups` now aggregates all
  matching lines from `sshd -T` output.**
  When `AllowUsers` entries are specified across separate drop-in files,
  OpenSSH emits one `allowusers <user>` line per entry in `sshd -T` output:
  ```
  allowusers nathan
  allowusers golan
  ```
  The previous `_ssh_val` helper used `awk` with `exit` on first match,
  returning only `nathan` and silently dropping `golan`. The checker then
  reported `AllowUsers: nathan` and suppressed the WARN — masking the fact
  that the allowlist appeared configured when only one of the intended users
  was visible.

  Added `_ssh_val_all` helper that collects all values across every matching
  line (space-joined). `AllowUsers` and `AllowGroups` now use `_ssh_val_all`.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/test_security_hardening.sh`: added T25.
  T25: `_ssh_val_all` with two `allowusers` lines returns both users
  space-joined; regression guard against first-match-only lookup.

### KFC — new entry

**KFC-SH03** (security-hardening component, `check_ssh_security`)

- **Version observed:** v2.1.16–v2.1.19
- **Failure mode:** `AllowUsers`/`AllowGroups` checked via `_ssh_val`
  (first-match awk). When users are in separate drop-ins, `sshd -T` emits
  one `allowusers` line per user. Only the first is returned; the rest are
  silently dropped. Checker reports the allowlist as configured (✓) based
  on the first user alone, masking missing entries.
- **Root cause:** `awk '...{print $2; exit}'` exits after the first match.
  Multi-line directives require aggregation across all matching lines.
- **Fix applied:** v2.1.20 — `_ssh_val_all` collects all values; used for
  `AllowUsers` and `AllowGroups`.
- **Current-version mitigation:** T25 guards against regression to
  single-match lookup for allow-list directives.

---

## [2.1.19] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **`check_ssh_security()`: `sshd -T` probe replaced — `| head -1` caused SIGPIPE
  failure under `pipefail`.**
  The previous probe was:
  ```
  if sshd -T -C ... | head -1 >/dev/null; then
      effective_config="$(sshd -T -C ... )"
  fi
  ```
  `sshd -T` emits ~150 lines. `head -1` reads one line and exits, sending
  SIGPIPE (exit 141) to `sshd`. Under `set -o pipefail` the pipe exits 141
  (non-zero), making the `if` condition false on every run. `effective_config`
  was never populated; the script always fell back to grepping
  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` directly, silently missing every directive set in
  drop-ins under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`.

  Fixed by capturing output in a single assignment with `|| true`:
  ```
  effective_config="$(sshd -T -C ... 2>/dev/null)" || true
  ```
  Emptiness of `effective_config` (genuine `sshd -T` failure) is tested
  afterward. This also eliminates the redundant second `sshd -T` invocation
  the old probe required.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/test_security_hardening.sh`: added T24.
  T24: regression guard — source must not contain `| head -1` on the same
  line as the `sshd -T` capture; that pattern causes SIGPIPE under pipefail.

### KFC — new entry

**KFC-SH02** (security-hardening component, `check_ssh_security`)

- **Version observed:** v2.1.16–v2.1.18
- **Failure mode:** `sshd -T` probe uses `| head -1 >/dev/null` to test
  success. `sshd -T` produces ~150 lines; `head -1` exits after one line,
  sending SIGPIPE (exit 141) to `sshd`. Under `set -o pipefail` the pipe
  exits 141. The `if` is false; `effective_config` is never set; the fallback
  to `sshd_config` file-grep fires on every run. All drop-in directives
  (e.g. `MaxAuthTries`, `AllowUsers`) are invisible to the checker.
- **Root cause:** Probing a multi-line-output command with `| head -1` under
  `pipefail` is structurally unsound. The SIGPIPE from `head` propagates as a
  non-zero pipe exit.
- **Fix applied:** v2.1.19 — single `$(...) || true` assignment; emptiness
  tested afterward.
- **Current-version mitigation:** T24 guards against regression to the
  `| head -1` probe pattern.

---



### Fixed

- **`check_ssh_security()`: `sshd -T` now invoked with `-C` context flags.**
  OpenSSH ≥6.5 requires a synthetic connection context
  (`user=root,host=localhost,addr=127.0.0.1,laddr=127.0.0.1,lport=22`) when
  any `Match` block is present in the server configuration. Without `-C`,
  `sshd -T` exits non-zero even when `sshd` itself is healthy. The script
  treated any non-zero exit as a failure and fell back to grepping
  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` directly — silently missing all directives set in
  drop-ins under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` (e.g. `99-hardening.conf`).
  The result was that hardening directives applied via drop-ins were reported
  as absent (WARN) even though sshd was enforcing them.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/test_security_hardening.sh`: added T23.
  T23: regression guard — source must contain the `-C` context flag string
  in the `sshd -T` invocation; a bare `sshd -T` without `-C` is a defect.

### KFC — new entry

**`check-for-updates` / `security-hardening` shared pattern — KFC-SH01**
(security-hardening component, `check_ssh_security`)

- **Version observed:** v2.1.16–v2.1.17
- **Failure mode:** `sshd -T` exits non-zero on hosts that have `Match`
  blocks in `sshd_config` (including the Ubuntu default
  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf`). Script falls back to
  file-grep, missing all drop-in directives. SSH checks report WARN for
  settings that are in fact configured.
- **Root cause:** OpenSSH ≥6.5 requires `-C user=…,host=…,addr=…` context
  when evaluating `Match` blocks. Without it, `sshd -T` cannot resolve
  conditional blocks and aborts.
- **Fix applied:** v2.1.18 — `sshd -T -C user=root,host=localhost,addr=127.0.0.1,laddr=127.0.0.1,lport=22`
- **Current-version mitigation:** Fallback to file-grep is retained; it
  now only triggers if the context-injected call also fails (true pre-install
  environment or corrupt sshd binary). T23 guards against regression to bare
  `sshd -T`.

## [2.1.17] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **ERR trap firing spuriously on every `[[ "$status" != "CRITICAL" ]] && status="WARN"` expression.**
  Under `set -Eeuo pipefail`, when `$status` is already `"CRITICAL"` the `[[ ]]` test
  exits 1 (false condition), the `&&` short-circuits without executing the assignment, and
  `set -E` propagates the exit-1 to the ERR trap — printing a false
  `ERROR on line N (exit 0)` for each call. This pattern appeared 7 times across
  `check_ssh_security`, `check_kernel_security`, `check_auditd`, and
  `check_unattended_upgrades_scope`. Fixed all 7 by appending `|| true` so the
  compound expression always exits 0 regardless of the `[[ ]]` result.

- **`check_shadow_hash_algorithm()` reported CRITICAL DES hashes for Ubuntu 24.04
  system accounts** (`systemd-network`, `systemd-timesync`, `systemd-resolve`,
  `polkitd`, `fwupd-refresh`). Ubuntu 24.04 locks service accounts by writing `!*`
  in the `/etc/shadow` password field (locked-with-note convention). The previous
  skip condition used exact matches (`"!"`, `"!!"`, `"*"`), which did not match `"!*"`.
  Since `"!*"` does not start with `$`, it fell through to the DES branch and was
  reported as a crackable hash. Fixed by replacing the exact-match check with a
  prefix match: `[[ "$password" == "!"* || "$password" == "*" ]]`.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/test_security_hardening.sh`: added T21 and T22.
  T21: ERR trap regression — `status=CRITICAL` is preserved and the expression
  exits 0 under `set -Eeuo pipefail`. T22: shadow DES regression — `!*`, `!`, `!!`,
  and `*` are all classified as SKIP (locked), not DES.

---

## [2.1.16] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **SSH check now uses `sshd -T`** (effective configuration dump) instead of
  grepping `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Ubuntu 22.04+ processes `Include` directives
  and drop-ins in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` which take precedence over the main
  file; grepping the main file missed any overrides in those files. `sshd -T`
  returns the fully resolved effective configuration, handling all includes.
  Falls back to file-grep with a WARN if `sshd -T` fails (e.g. pre-install
  environment).

- **`PasswordAuthentication` default corrected.** The script previously warned
  "default: yes" when the directive was absent. The compiled default changed to
  `no` in OpenSSH 8.8 (Ubuntu 22.04+). The old message would mislead operators
  into thinking the server accepted password logins when it did not.

- **`check_file_permissions()` octal comparison replaced with bitwise AND.**
  The previous `actual_dec > expected_dec` numeric comparison does not correctly
  model Unix permission semantics: `640 > 600` numerically but `600` has no bits
  that `640` lacks; neither is universally "more permissive" than the other.
  Fixed to `actual & ~expected & 0777`: fires WARN only when the actual mode has
  bits set that the expected mode does not.

- **`check_sudo_configuration()` NOPASSWD scan now covers `/etc/sudoers.d/*`.**
  The previous grep was limited to `/etc/sudoers`; a NOPASSWD entry in a drop-in
  (the recommended Ubuntu pattern for site-local rules) was silently missed.
  Changed to `grep -rv` across both paths.

- **VERSION constant** was `2.1.14`; file header said `2.1.15`. Bumped to
  `2.1.16` so the version reported in email matches the actual deployed version.

### Added

- **`check_ssh_security()`**: four new checks: `MaxAuthTries` (should be ≤4;
  default 6 allows brute-force); `LoginGraceTime` (should be ≤30s; default 120s);
  `ClientAliveInterval`/`ClientAliveCountMax` (idle session termination); and
  `AllowUsers`/`AllowGroups` (allowlist enforcement — absence means any valid
  account may attempt login).

- **`check_kernel_security()`**: seven additional sysctl parameters:
  `kernel.randomize_va_space` (full ASLR, =2), `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope` (=1),
  `fs.protected_hardlinks` (=1), `fs.protected_symlinks` (=1),
  `net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects` (=0), `net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects`
  (=0), `net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter` (=1), `net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians` (=1).

- **`check_auditd()`**: verifies auditd is installed, enabled, and running; warns
  if no audit rules are loaded. Auditd provides the tamper-evident record of
  privileged commands, file access, and authentication events required by CIS
  benchmarks.

- **`check_shadow_hash_algorithm()`**: scans `/etc/shadow` for MD5 (`$1$`) and
  DES (no `$` prefix) password hashes; reports CRITICAL if found. Reports WARN
  for SHA-256 (`$5$`). Skips locked (`!`, `*`) accounts.

- **`check_unattended_upgrades_scope()`**: verifies that a `-security` origin is
  present and uncommented in `Allowed-Origins` in
  `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`. The existing `check_automatic_updates()`
  check only verified the scheduler was on; this check verifies security updates
  are actually in scope.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/test_security_hardening.sh`: added T10–T20 (11 new tests).
  T10: `sshd -T` effective config parsing. T11: MaxAuthTries > 4 → WARN.
  T12: `randomize_va_space` present in kernel params. T13: `yama.ptrace_scope`
  present. T14: bitwise perm check — 640 vs 600 → WARN. T15: 600 vs 644 → OK
  (more restrictive is acceptable). T16: NOPASSWD in sudoers.d drop-in detected.
  T17: MD5 hash → CRITICAL. T18: yescrypt hash → OK. T19: security origin in
  50unattended-upgrades detected. T20: absent security origin → WARN condition.

## [2.1.15] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Password Policy check** — replaced file-only detection (`[[ -f /etc/security/pwquality.conf ]]`) with a dual check: `libpam-pwquality` package installed **and** `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` present. Eliminates false-positive WARN on servers where the file exists but the installed-version check was inconsistent.
- **Sudo logging check** — replaced single-file grep of `/etc/sudoers` with `grep -rE` across both `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/`. Correctly detects `Defaults logfile=` when configured in a drop-in file (Ubuntu best practice). Eliminates false-positive WARN on servers using `/etc/sudoers.d/logging`.

---

## [2.1.14] — current

See version history in `src/security-hardening-check.sh` header for
the full pre-repo history (v1.0.0–v2.1.14).

This component was moved into `pb-server-tools` at v2.1.14 without
functional changes. All future changes will be logged here.
